<p style = "font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Today we arrived in the Caribbean island of <b>Jamaica</b>! It was a long flight but we made it!
    <br>
    I am ready to have some fun and swim in the ocean and go on a cruise! My family has been wanting to go on a cruise for a while!
    <br>
    When we got on the cruise, they had a pool and an all-you-can-eat buffet! It was so good!
    <br>
    They had a huge water park and a big recreation center with ping pong, darts, pickleball, and so much more! There was everything I could imagine!

<p style = "font-family: cursive;"> Today we decided to wake up and watch the sunrise. We had to wake up pretty early but it was worth it!
    <br>
    The sun was so pretty reflecting off the water, creating a picture perfect morning.
    <br>
    We then decided to go an swim in the <del>lake</del> ocean. It was very salty but not as cold as the other times I have been in the ocean.
    <br>
    After that we went and got some <i>authentic</i> caribbean cuisine and some tropical smoothies which was really good.
    <br>
    We had a <em>great</em> second day!

<p style="font-family: monospace;"> Today was super fun! We woke up and did an early morning kayaking tour! It was great! I hadn't been kayaking in forever!

    <br>
    After that we grabbed some lunch and then headed over to a ziplining tour!
    <br>
    We were up so high in the air! It was pretty and scary at the same time! My mom was too scared to go on so she stayed behind!
    <br>
    We then went back by the ocean to watch the pretty sunset. It is so relaxing at night and a good way to end our third day!
    <br>
    We also learned some Caribbean/Spanish words!
