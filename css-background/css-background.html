    We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. It all happens automatically.

    Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You're meant to have fun in life.
    
    We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Learn when to stop. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.
    
    Now then, let's play. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You have to make these big decisions. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?
    
    Only eight colors that you need. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.
    
    And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?
    
    We can fix anything. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.
    
    Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. In life you need colors.
    
    Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.
    
    Just use the old one inch brush. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Have fun with it. Let your imagination be your guide. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.
    
    Let all these things just sort of happen. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.
