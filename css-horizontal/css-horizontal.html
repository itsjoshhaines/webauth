            They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Here's something that's fun. You can get away with a lot. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

            Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

            Learn when to stop. Isn't that fantastic? Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.

            In your world you have total and absolute power. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Only eight colors that you need. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.

            A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. See there how easy that is. Fluff that up.

            It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Just beat the devil out of it. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

            Brown is such a nice color. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

            Learn when to stop. Isn't that fantastic? Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around.

            In your world you have total and absolute power. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Only eight colors that you need. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown.

            A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. See there how easy that is. Fluff that up.

            It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Just beat the devil out of it. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.

            Brown is such a nice color. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

            They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Here's something that's fun. You can get away with a lot. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

            Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.
