    We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. It all happens automatically.

    Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You're meant to have fun in life.
    
    We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Learn when to stop. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.
    
    Now then, let's play. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You have to make these big decisions. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?
    
    Only eight colors that you need. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too.
    
    And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes?
    
    We can fix anything. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.
